You've just entered the corner of **Abhigyan Dwivedi** (aka Arpit) — a curious coder, anime enthusiast , and a CSE undergrad who’s always leveling up both in code and in life 🚀

Whether it's breaking down machine logic or diving deep into the world of anime storylines, I find joy in connecting patterns—digital or emotional.
